    print(recommendation)
```

## üîß Technical Architecture

### No Smart Contracts Required! ‚úÖ

This advisor works by:

1. **Reading existing blockchain data** using PySui GraphQL queries
2. **Analyzing portfolio composition** with built-in algorithms
3. **Providing insights** based on DeFi best practices
4. **Suggesting optimizations** using existing Sui protocols

### Key Components

```python
class SuiDeFiAdvisor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize PySui GraphQL client
        cfg = PysuiConfiguration(group_name=PysuiConfiguration.SUI_GQL_RPC_GROUP)
        self.client = SyncGqlClient(pysui_config=cfg, write_schema=False)
    
    def analyze_portfolio(self, address: str):
        # Get coin balances
        balances = self.client.execute_query_node(
            with_node=qn.GetAllCoinBalances(owner=address)
        )
        
        # Get owned objects
        objects = self.client.execute_query_node(
            with_node=qn.GetObjectsOwnedByAddress(owner=address)
        )
        
        # Analyze and return insights
        return self._analyze_portfolio_data(balances, objects)
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Personal Portfolio Management
```python
# Check your own portfolio
my_address = "0x123..."
advisor = SuiDeFiAdvisor()
insights = advisor.analyze_portfolio(my_address)
```

### 2. Multi-Address Monitoring
```python
# Monitor multiple wallets
addresses = ["0x123...", "0x456...", "0x789..."]
for addr in addresses:
    report = advisor.generate_report(addr)
    print(f"Report for {addr}:\n{report}\n")
```

### 3. Staking Strategy
```python
# Find best staking opportunities
staking_ops = advisor.get_staking_opportunities()
print("Best staking strategies:")
for rec in staking_ops['recommendations']:
    print(f"  ‚Ä¢ {rec}")
```

## üìà Advanced Features

### Risk Assessment Algorithm

The advisor categorizes portfolios based on:

- **Asset Count**: More assets = lower risk
- **Diversification**: Different coin types reduce concentration risk
- **Object Holdings**: NFTs and DeFi positions add complexity

```python
def _calculate_risk_level(self, coin_count: int, unique_assets: int) -> str:
    if coin_count == 0:
        return "High"  # Empty portfolio
    elif coin_count <= 1:
        return "High"  # Single asset
    elif coin_count <= 3:
        return "Medium"  # Limited diversification
    else:
        return "Low"  # Well diversified
```

### Recommendation Engine

Personalized advice based on portfolio composition:

```python
def _generate_recommendations(self, coin_count: int, coin_types: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    if coin_count == 0:
        return ["üöÄ Start by acquiring some SUI tokens"]
    elif coin_count <= 2:
        return ["üåà Diversify into stablecoins", "üí∞ Start staking SUI tokens"]
    else:
        return ["‚öñÔ∏è Review portfolio balance", "üìà Consider yield farming"]
```

### Common Issues

**Q: "Client not initialized" error**
```
A: Make sure you have internet connection. The advisor needs to connect to Sui GraphQL endpoint.
```

**Q: Address analysis returns empty results**
```
A: Verify the address format is correct (starts with 0x). Some addresses might have no assets.
```

**Q: Staking analysis fails**
```
A: This might be due to network issues or Sui GraphQL endpoint being unavailable.
